# This is an example ecoscript configuration file.
# Config files are written in [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/), but this quick
# reference should be enough to get you up and running without any prior
# knowledge
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# A config file is composed of
# sections, which can have sub-sections, and so on. Sections are denoted by a
# section name and a colon followed by the content of that section. Lines
# beginning with a pound sign (`#`) are ignored. The
# content of each section MUST be indented, and each line MUST have the same
# level of indentation. Sub-sections follow the same format, relative to the
# indentation level of the parent section. Spaces, not tabs, must be used
# for indentation. Most text editors can be configured so that pressing the
# tab keys inserts an appropriate number of spaces.

# Config files must begin with three hyphens on a separate line.
# This signals the start of the document.

# ## World
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The `world` section describes the layout of the world.
world:

  # The `legend` specifices what each character in the `map` represents (see
  # `map` below). Each line starts with a text character surrounded by
  # single quotes, followed by a colon and a space, and then followed by
  # the name of an organism. The organism names must each correspond with
  # an organism definition in the `organisms` section below. There is one
  # exception to this: the `wall` organism is already defined for you, so 
  # you can just include it in your map.
  #
  # In this `legend`,
  legend:
      # an *equals sign* represents a wall,
      '=': wall
      # an *asterisk* represents a shrub,
      '*': shrub
      # the *letter H* represents an herbivore,
      'H': herbivore
      # and an *at sign* represents a predator.
      '@': predator 

  # The `map` specificies the layout of the world as a grid. Each line in the
  # map represents a row in the grid, and each character in the row represents
  # an entity in the world. The meaning of each character is specificied in
  # the `legend`, above. Each row must begin with a hyphen '-' followed by a
  # space, and the following text must be enclosed in single quotes.
  map:
      - '========================='
      - '=H=         *         =H='
      - '=H=                   =H='
      - '=H=                   =H='
      - '= =                   = ='
      - '=                       ='
      - '=                       ='
      - '=                       ='
      - '=           H           ='
      - '=           H           ='
      - '=   **     ===     **   ='
      - '=  ****    =@=    ****  ='
      - '= = **     = =     **  *='
      - '= =       == =        **='
      - '= ==    === ==      ****='
      - '= =======  ==***  ******='
      - '=         ==************='
      - '========================='

# ## Organisms
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The `organisms` section defines each organism in the world. Each organism 
# has a `type`, a set of `properties`, and a set of `actions`. The organism's
# `type` determines which properties can be defined. `type` can be one of
# `animal` or `plant`.
#
# All organisms, regardless of type, must have the following `properties`:
#
#   - `species`: The organism's species. This is often the same as the name
#     of the section in which the organism is being defined, but it
#     can be anything.
#   - `baseEnergy`: The amount of energy the organism starts with.
#   - `maxEnergy`: The maximum energy the organism can have. This is also
#      amount of energy it needs to reproduce.
#
# Plants must also have the following additional `properties`:
#
#   - `growthRate`: The amount of energy the plant gains on each turn.
#
# Animals must also have the following additional `properties`:
#
#   - `movementCost`: The amount of energy expended to move.
#   - `metabolism`: The amount of energy expended each turn, regardless
#     of what actions it took.
#   - `senseRadius`: How many units away the animal can sense other organisms.
#   - `diet`: A list of `species` that the animal can eat.
#
# In addition, each organism can optionally be given a sequence of actions.
# I won't go into too much detail just yet because this feature is undergoing
# maintenance, but essentially the way it works is this:
#
# 1. Actions are defined in a sequence.
# 2. When its the organism's turn to act, each action is executed in order
#    until one succeeds. Thus, only one action is executed per turn.
# 3. Each organism has a default set of actions that it runs through before
#    the actions defined here. If one of those succeeds, the actions here
#    are never executed. For more information on default actions, go
#    [here](world.html) and read the comments on `World#turn`.
